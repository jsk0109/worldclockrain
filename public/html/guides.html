        <h2>Master Adding Clocks</h2>
        <p>Want to keep track of time in your favorite cities? With World Clock Rainbow, adding custom clocks is a breeze! Head to the "Add Your Own Clock" section on the homepage. Type a city name (like "Paris") in the search bar‚Äîtwo letters are enough for suggestions to pop up. Hit "Add Clock" to see it appear, with a limit of six clocks at a time. Need to remove one? Just click the "X" in the clock‚Äôs top-right corner. Try swapping out the default New York or London clocks to personalize your display. It‚Äôs a colorful way to stay connected across time zones!</p>
        <h2>Smart Time Zone Search Tips</h2>
        <p>Finding the right time zone doesn‚Äôt have to be tricky. World Clock Rainbow‚Äôs search tools make it quick and fun! Use the search bar at the top of the homepage to type a city name‚Äî"Tok" will bring up Tokyo instantly. Start with a single letter like "S" to see Seoul, Sydney, and San Francisco in seconds. For faster results, click a continent button (Asia, Europe, etc.) before searching to narrow it down. Explore cities you love or plan to visit, and let time zone discovery spark your next adventure!</p>
        <h2>Plan Global Meetings with Ease</h2>
        <p>Coordinating a call across continents? World Clock Rainbow has you covered.

For more precision, visit the "Zone Shift" page to compare current times and UTC offsets across multiple cities. Click "Suggest Meeting Time" to get recommendations that fit everyone‚Äôs workday (9 AM to 5 PM). Bonus tip: Check the weather below each clock for a fun conversation starter. Make global teamwork seamless and stress-free!</p>
        <h2>Understanding Daylight Saving Time</h2>
        <p>Daylight Saving Time (DST) can feel like a puzzle, but World Clock Rainbow simplifies it. DST shifts clocks forward an hour in summer to extend daylight, common in places like Europe and North America. For example, New York moves ahead in March and back in November. Our clocks automatically adjust for DST‚Äîcheck London to see it switch from UTC+0 in winter to UTC+1 in summer. Not every city uses DST, though; Seoul and Tokyo stay steady year-round. Search cities to compare, and trust our accurate times to keep your schedule on track. Dive into the time zone puzzle with confidence!</p>
        <h2>Manage Schedules Across Time Differences</h2>
        <p>Stay on top of a global lifestyle with World Clock Rainbow‚Äôs tools for handling time differences. Pin frequently checked cities like San Francisco or Berlin to "Add Your Own Clock" for instant time checks. On the "Zone Shift" page, pick a city and time (say, 3 PM in New York) to see what it means elsewhere‚ÄîSydney‚Äôs 9 AM might be London‚Äôs midnight! Pair our clocks with your calendar to avoid time zone mix-ups. Whether you‚Äôre a freelancer, remote worker, or traveler, these tricks help you plan smarter. Ready to take control of your global schedule?</p>
