                        <p>A time zone is a region of the world that observes a uniform standard time, usually based on its longitude, to simplify global timekeeping.</p>

                        <p>Some regions, like India (+5:30) or Nepal (+5:45), use half-hour or quarter-hour offsets to align better with local solar time or historical preferences.</p>
